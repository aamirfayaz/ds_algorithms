 
Knights and tours should work for 10 * 10 boards
--> check with the knights tour first
--> if it works then check for the modified tour as given in tc interview
--> check whatever the initial position, we should always get atleast 1 tour
--> so if things doesn' work out with backtracking, then try with warendoffs algorithm

--> take a look at tc question for reference

[

 there feedback was:
 -> not enough tests, readme, build file, duh
 -> most of the initial positions were throwing errors, so they 
   suggested this is becoz i am using warendoff not backtracking but GFG solution works for all cases 
   using warendoff algo, but board is 8 *8, i am not able to modify for 10 * 10
